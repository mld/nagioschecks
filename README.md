============

First off, I'm not very much of a programmer anymore, if I ever was. 
Please take that into consideratation when you look at the code.

The first script, cacertcheck.pl, was made to look for soon to be invalid certificates 
in CA certificate chain files but may as easily be used for checking validity on single
certificates too.
